      <h1>Who <span>we</span> are....</h1>
<h4 class="info">
        We’re a vibrant collective of experienced piano teachers who believe that
        learning to play the piano should be an inspirational, enjoyable and collaborative
        experience. Together we’re growing a creative and supportive community of accomplished musicians,
        who delight in discovering more about music.
        Founded in 2012, our vision has always been to transform the way instrumental teaching is done. Traditional
        piano lessons focus almost completely on one style of music (generally classical) and don’t usually have much
        room for input or ideas from the student. They also involve learning – and teaching – on your own. But we 
        believe that engaging with music in community is not only more fun but significantly more effective, better
        shaping someone as a whole musician as well as a pianist. We think that collaboration, both between teachers
        and students and also with other musicians, is one of the best and most interesting ways to learn. We’re also
       committed to creativity and having fun with music, teaching a wide variety of styles and techniques as well 
        as encouraging the creation of new music.
        Ultimately our aim is to set people up for a lifetime of loving music, giving them the skills, the inspiration and the confidence they need to embrace whatever musical opportunities come their way.
